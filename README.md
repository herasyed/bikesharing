### Summary
From these visualizations we can see that men are the largest demographic that use the bikesharing service. Among the men who use the service, those who are subscribed are far more likely to use the service than those who are not. We could assume that people use the bikesharing service as a way to commute to their jobs during the work week, and for leisure on the weekends. Further analysis on the age of users and their bikesharing usage would be interesting to look into. The stations with the most traffic might also be important to look at, in order to see where it might make sense to put up stations in Des Moines.
